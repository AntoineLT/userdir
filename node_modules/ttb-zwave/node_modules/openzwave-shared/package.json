  "readme": "node-openzwave-shared\n=====================\n\nThis is a node.js add-on for node 0.10.x *and* 0.12.x (and possibly\neven for NodeJS's 3 and 4, with the help of NAN), which wraps the [Open\nZ-Wave](http://www.openzwave.com/) library to provide access to a\nZ-Wave network from within node.js (server-side JavaScript.)\n\n<img src=\"https://nodejs.org/static/images/logos/nodejs.png\" style=\"width: 200px\"/>\n<img src=\"http://www.openzwave.com/css/ozwlogo.png\"/>\n\nYou can now easily control *and manage* your [ZWave](http://www.z-wave.com/) devices\n(lights, dimmers, blinds, you name it) from within [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) applications.\nInitial support for *secure* devices (eg door locks) that require encryption is also included.\n\nCheck out the [Node-Red integration project](https://github.com/OpenZWave/node-red-contrib-openzwave)\nfor an interesting use case, in which I've wired up ZWave and KNX devices working together as\none big happy automated home.\n\nThis addon is currently able to:\n- *scan* a Z-Wave network and report on connected devices,\n- *write* values to zwave nodes\n- *monitor* the network for changes,\n- *heal* nodes and/or the network\n- *perform* management tasks (add/remove nodes, replace failed nodes, manage their group associations etc)\n\n**Important notice**\n\nThis library differs from its [ancestor library](https://github.com/jperkin/node-openzwave)\nin that it links *dynamically* to an OpenZWave **shared library**\nby means of your system dynamic linker. This is  in contrast to\n*statically* linking OpenZWave as part of the node.js addon.\n\nThus you need to have OpenZWave fully installed on your system (both the\ncompiled library AND the development headers) before trying to install this little baby.\nI know this diverges from the dominant npm paradigm, but with the shared lib approach:\n  - compilation / installation is a lot faster and\n  - OZW *minor* upgrades / bugfixes are way lot easier.\n\nThis also means that you need to be careful if you upgrade your\nOZW library: you might need to rebuild this addon, otherwise you'd might\nget api mismatch exceptions.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n### Linux/OSX\n\nYou will need to ensure the OpenZWave library and headers are\ninstalled first. You can do this one of two ways.\n\n- Manually compiling OpenZwave involves the usual dance of 1) downloading its source tarball\n([latest code from GitHub](https://github.com/OpenZWave/open-zwave/archive/master.zip) or\n[a stable release](https://github.com/OpenZWave/open-zwave/releases)) or\nfrom [the OpenZWave snapshots repository](http://old.openzwave.com/snapshots/)\nand then 2) compiling it and installing on your system (`make && sudo make install`)\n\n- You could also install OpenZWave via a [precompiled package that's suitable for your Linux distribution and architecture](http://old.openzwave.com/downloads/).\n**Notice:** Be sure to install *BOTH the binary (libopenzwave-x.y) AND the development\npackage (libopenzwave-dev).*\n\n### Windows\n\nSince there is no standard installation location for Open Z-Wave on Windows, it will be automatically downloaded, compiled, and installed when you install this module.\n\n## Installation\n\n**Node.JS >= 3.0 users**: please send me reports if the addon works or breaks.\nI've had very bad experience with the NodeJS API quicksand already, and NAN\nappears to not be able to keep up. The NodeJS API is truly a wizard's tribute to Ctrl+Z.\n\nWhenever you have OpenZWave installed in your machine, then all you need to do is:\n```\n$ npm install openzwave-shared\n```\n\n## Development documentation\n\n- [Basic API usage](../master/README-api.md)\n- [List of supported events](../master/README-events.md)\n- [Management of nodes](../master/README-mgmt.md)\n- [Security API](../master/README-security.md)\n- [Usage example](../master/README-example.md)\n\n## Environment-specific documentation\n- [Installing on Rapsbian](../master/README-raspbian.md)\n- [Installing on Ubuntu 15.04](../master/README-ubuntu.md)\n\n## License\n\nThe [Open Z-Wave](http://www.openzwave.com/) library that this\nmodule heavily relies upon is licensed under the Lesser GPLv3.\n\nEverything else (all the bits that I and Jonathan have written)\nis under the vastly more sensible ISC license.\n",
